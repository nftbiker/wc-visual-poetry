Paul de Vree. 1966.  
  
"This poem can be said or seen as a graphic structure. The ? crosses the lines and causes a vibration. It may also be taken as the staff of a bishop with the implication of sacramental marriage.  
  
The question: the rapport between man and woman. Are women happy? Are men honest?" (P. de V.)
