Adriano Spatola, from Zeroglifico. 1966  
  
Spatola took the cut-up method, popularized by William S. Burroughs & Brion Gysin, and applied it to a single word in Zeroglifico. This technique, which typically rearranges texts to form new narratives, was used to dissect & reassemble a word, turning it into a visual art form.
