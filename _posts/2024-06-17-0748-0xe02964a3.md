Lace Ciphers, 2022

The problem of long-repeat strings generating delicate encodings has been known to signal processing people for decades. USB use(d) NRZI/RLL-6 encoding which forces a change between knit and purl once per seven stitches. Most Ethernet today uses 'Manchester' coding, which encodes bits as _pairs_ of signals, so for example 1 \-> knit-purl, 0 \-> purl-knit. If applied to knitting the structure from this encoding can get very wavy over short stretches.
