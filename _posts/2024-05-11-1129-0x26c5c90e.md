Vito Acconci (1940–2017), Trademarks, 1970, photo-offset lithograph and colour lithograph  
  
'In Trademarks, Acconci established a task to execute and then performed it diligently, biting as many parts of his naked body as he could reach and documenting his self-mutilation with photographs and printer’s ink.'
