poster design for    
'Alcools' by Gullaume Apollinaire  
  
now in the public domain, text   
printed in its entirety on a single page,   
in the highly legible tiny font 'minuscule',   
design by Pierre Jeanneau   
  
scrambling to see how many of   
these virtuoso visual poetry pieces   
i can collect, ship & frame!
