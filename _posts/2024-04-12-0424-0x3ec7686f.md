Atelier's *Visual Poetry* exhibition will come to a close on Friday.  
  
I'm especially excited about *Conceits*, a generative concrete poetry chapbook by the artist Onek Monk, which seeks to illustrate illusions, delusions, aspirations, hypotheticals & counterfactuals.   
  
I'm crazy about unicode, so this is my jam!
