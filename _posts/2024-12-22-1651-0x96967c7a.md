#monochrome-monday is here!  
  
Visual poetry thrives in monochrome—raw, striking, and poetic. Share your typewriter, ASCII, or poetry-inspired works in /visual-poetry channel.  
  
I’ll distribute 5k DEGEN & support as many minted submissions as I can. The channel is open to all!  
  
Initiative by @vortac & @dennis-chilas
