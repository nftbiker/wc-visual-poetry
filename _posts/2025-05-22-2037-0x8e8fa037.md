Guy de Cointet
It is the Norwegian way to say good evening, 1978

I love the light humoured style of Guy de Cointet's titles as a counterpoint to his hard geometric minimalism.

Some really nice works at his website >

X friend John Supko remarked that my Tauba Auerbach post reminded him of de Cointet's work and for sure there are overlaps in style. I couldnâ€™t resist delving in the de Cointet's back catalogue.
