from Keyboards by Catherine Vidler

my dear friend passed away this time last year after a long bout with cancer. Catherine was a prolific and inventive visual poet, expert at producing variations on a theme. before she died, she entrusted me with thousands of her poems. she was weird and brilliant and i miss her.
