Teatro dâ€™Incontro Ideologico (1968)
With the opening of the curtain appear two steps separated by a moat so the spectators on one side transform into the actors of the others. Two megaphones allow them to communicate and insult from one side to the other. The pit allows the side change to be impossible and no fights occur.

Teatro della Form Premeditata (1968)
When the curtain disappears, the scene consists of a series of people around an opaque and voluminous piece that makes it impossible to communicate between them, arranged as if it were a banquet.
