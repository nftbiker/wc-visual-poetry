Ilse and Pierre Garnier(1965)  
  
"Light and shadow, vertical and horizontal, the card game of creation; the i is the letter that stands out, rises up; the e is the gray letter, always turned in on itself.  
  
The two fields of letters confront one another across a breach, that of the 'nothingness' between existences."(P.G.)
