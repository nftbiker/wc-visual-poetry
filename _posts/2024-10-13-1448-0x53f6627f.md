33 Questions Per Minute" (2000) by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer is a generative installation that uses grammatical rules to combine words from a dictionary, generating 4.7 trillion questionsâ€”an algorithm that will take 271,000 years to complete. The beepers present 33 questions per minute, loosely rooted in the tradition of poetry. With no time for reflection, the installation transforms into a surreal highlighting the absurdity of the questions themselves.
