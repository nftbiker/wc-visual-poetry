Hannah Weiner
Code Poems, 1968

In the 1960s, Weiner created a series of found poems using The International Code of Signals: morse code, semaphores, and maritime signal flags. For Weiner, these poems were unhindered by distance, origin, or language, allowing for a universal language of abstract visual and aural signs.
