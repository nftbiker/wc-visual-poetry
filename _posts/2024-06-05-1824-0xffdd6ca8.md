i've been creating erasure poetry for a couple of years and am exploring new directions. this WIP is erasure + chaotic marginalia/annotations, all of which i'm obsessed with!

the background text is from the work of German philosopher Sloterdijk, largely thanks to an excellent creative prompt proposed by @lonewick
