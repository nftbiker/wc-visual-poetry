Raúl Zurita (1950) is a Chilean poet, writer, and artist who reshaped Latin American poetry with Purgatorio, published in 1979. It stands as one of the most significant works created during the Pinochet dictatorship (1973–1990). Through fragmented poetry, diagrams of the human body, and depictions of Chilean landscapes, Zurita crafted verses that reflect both individual and collective anguish. The book serves as a metaphor for the body, symbolizing the nation’s pain and endurance. This seminal exemplifies how art can challenge oppression and inspire hope; more than just poetry, it calls for remembrance, healing, and transcendence.
