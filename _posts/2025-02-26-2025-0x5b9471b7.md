Agile and incessant, the child peers out,
Eyes wide, gazing past the horizon.
With this limitless view, dreaming of the impossible,
Seeing worlds I, once, long to find again.
I try to imagine through those eyes,
To let my vision soar beyond reasonâ€™s grasp
Alive, evolving with every breath,
A boundless wonder of endless creation.
