👀 Received this beautiful artwork by @pixellare yesterday as a token of gratitude for having supported with tipping. This is a really nice gesture and much appreciated, fra 🙏

The title is "All we need is love" and it's an interactive token that unveils its color-encoded message after the click. All I can reveal is that each color represents a letter and that love is universal 🖤

Hope it fits the channel's objective 😅
