'Light Line' by Jenny Holzer   
on view at the Guggenheim!   
  
The exhibition highlights the incisive use of the written word across time + media in Holzer’s practice. A giant LED sign, and a selection of Holzer’s works from the 70s to the present day, including paintings, works on paper, and stone pieces.
