1. ðŸ§µ   
  
Short thread about Japanese Fluxus artist Mieko Shiomi and her 1963 artwork titled 'Word Event', the first work in her series of 'Spatial Poems'.    
  
A performative work of poetry, it reminds me of Yoko Ono's conceptual book 'Grapefruit', and of Brian Eno's 'Oblique Strategies', published a decade later.
