Ch√∂gyam Trungpa's (Tibet.1940-1987) besides being the first translating Tibetan Buddhism outside of Tibet, was also a prolific poet. Trungpa used concrete poetry to bridge cultural gaps and express his experiences, including escaping from Tibet and adapting to Western culture. His poetry reflects a blend of Tibetan and Western elements, showing his longing for Tibet and desire to communicate across cultures. Trungpa's work challenges the traditional-modern divide, using visual poetry to convey meaning beyond language.
