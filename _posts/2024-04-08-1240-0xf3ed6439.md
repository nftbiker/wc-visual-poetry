'Incubaciones' (1940) by Mexican artist Arnaldo Coen

Includes a fragmentary text, such as the memory of the previous pages when reading a book, which are visible in the hollows of the pages, thus creating a flexible, mutable poem that can be read randomly in any direction. Carried out with the poet Francisco Serrano.
