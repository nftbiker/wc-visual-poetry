It's inspiring to encounter visual poetry at SFMOMA.

Recently stumbled upon Sky Hopinka's impressive 12+ ft vinyl calligram titled "Serpent Mound and the Worship of the Reciprocal Principles of Nature in America" during my visit.

Featuring text from a letter by Ralph Waldo Emerson to Martin Van Buren in 1838.
