  "text": "RaÃºl Zurita (1950) is a Chilean poet, writer, and artist who reshaped Latin American poetry with Purgatorio, published in 1979. It stands as one of the most significant works created during the Pinochet dictatorship (1973â€“1990). Through fragmented poetry, diagrams of the human body, and depictions of Chilean landscapes, Zurita crafted verses that reflect both individual and collective anguish. The book serves as a metaphor for the body, symbolizing the nationâ€™s pain and endurance. This seminal exemplifies how art can challenge oppression and inspire hope; more than just poetry, it calls for remembrance, healing, and transcendence.",
