  "text": "Emmett Williams. 1958. \n\n\"A rubber-stamp poem, from a genre I called 'universal poems,' probably because\nI furnished spectators with rubber stamps and let them construct the poems. The first was made at the Maiudstellingen in Copenhagen in 1960; the largest covered an entire wall of Gallery One in London in 1962.\" (EW)",
