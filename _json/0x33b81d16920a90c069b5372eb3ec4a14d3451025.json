I replaced that model with another identical one but he also died in exactly the same way, a week later. I guess I do things with the '100' that he was not designed to do, or perhaps certain mechanical parts are fatigued with oxidisation while the machine was sitting idle for years?\n\nLesson: Beware of typos in your invocations.",
