  "text": "Ilse & Pierre Garnier, Extension 2. 1964.\n\n\"The noun soleil is rich & one of the best for concrete poetry: the impact of its vowels, consonants, its vibrations & scintillations - soft & violent. And from this noun spring up other nouns-ile, elle, aile, oeil, io, sol - whence this progression radiates in space.\" (P.G.)",
