  "text": "Guy de Cointet\nIt is the Norwegian way to say good evening, 1978\n\nI love the light humoured style of Guy de Cointet's titles as a counterpoint to his hard geometric minimalism.\n\nSome really nice works at his website >\nhttps://www.guydecointet.org/dessin\n\nX friend John Supko remarked that my Tauba Auerbach post reminded him of de Cointet's work and for sure there are overlaps in style. I couldn’t resist delving in the de Cointet's back catalogue.",
