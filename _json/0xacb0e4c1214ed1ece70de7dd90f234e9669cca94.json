  "text": "another classic on interactive art & text:\n\"Text Rain\" (by Romy Achituv & Camille Utterback, 2000)\n.\n\"Text Rain is an interactive installation in which participants use the familiar instrument of their bodies, to do what seems magical—to lift and play with falling letters that do not really exist. In the Text Rain installation participants stand or move in front of a large projection screen. The letters respond to the participants’ motions and can be caught, lifted, and then let fall again. The falling text will ‘land’ on anything darker than a certain threshold, and ‘fall’ whenever that obstacle is removed.\"\n.\n+ info: https://camilleutterback.com/projects/text-rain/",
