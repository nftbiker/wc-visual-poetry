The program traverses a texture, searching for gaps in depth. When it identifies deep areas, it will draw lines, and when they are high, it will write text. The texture will then define the width and height of the letters and the direction of the lines.\n\nI collected #100 and #101 from a total of 128 individual outputs. Get yours and support, Tezos is on sale right now...\n\nðŸ‘‰ https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/barrage",
