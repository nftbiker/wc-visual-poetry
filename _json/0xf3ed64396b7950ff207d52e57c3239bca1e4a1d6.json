  "text": "'Incubaciones' (1940) by Mexican artist Arnaldo Coen\n\nIncludes a fragmentary text, such as the memory of the previous pages when reading a book, which are visible in the hollows of the pages, thus creating a flexible, mutable poem that can be read randomly in any direction. Carried out with the poet Francisco Serrano.",
