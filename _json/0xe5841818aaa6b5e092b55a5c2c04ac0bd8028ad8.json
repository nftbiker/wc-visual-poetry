  "text": "Hannah Weiner\nCode Poems, 1968\n\nIn the 1960s, Weiner created a series of found poems using The International Code of Signals: morse code, semaphores, and maritime signal flags. For Weiner, these poems were unhindered by distance, origin, or language, allowing for a universal language of abstract visual and aural signs.",
