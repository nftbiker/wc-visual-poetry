  "text": "Eduardo Kac, Geometria do ÃŠxtase, 1982. Runtime looped digital animation, silent, Apple III computer. In this poem we look straight down at the top surface of a cube, as new shadows are cast, the letters permutate to produce new words in multiple languages. The poem executes in a loop. Originally written in Basic, it was part of a series of experimental ASCII works that Kac created in the early 1980s. \n/gen-art",
