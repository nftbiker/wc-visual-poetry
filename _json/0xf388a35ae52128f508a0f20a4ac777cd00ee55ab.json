There is so much I want to tell my future self that words can't express: from the fear and anger I've felt in lockdown isolation to the joy in finding new friends and community. Each piece in this series becomes a small part of a much bigger story -- letters sent into the future expressing our collective hopes, fears, sadness, and love.\n\n@artblocks classic",
