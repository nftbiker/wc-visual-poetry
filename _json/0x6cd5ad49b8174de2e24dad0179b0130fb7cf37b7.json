This is a really nice gesture and much appreciated, fra 🙏\n\nThe title is \"All we need is love\" and it's an interactive token that unveils its color-encoded message after the click. All I can reveal is that each color represents a letter and that love is universal 🖤\n\nHope it fits the channel's objective 😅\n\n@objktcom @tezos",
