  "text": "Quipus, also known as khipus, were ancient recording devices used by the Inca Empire and earlier Andean cultures. They consisted of colored, knotted strings made from cotton or camelid fibers, used to store and convey information in the absence of a written language. The knots and colors represented numerical values and other data, functioning as a sophisticated accounting and communication system. Quipus were used for various purposes including census data, tax obligations, and possibly even narrative storytelling. Despite their complexity, much about their use remains a mystery today.\nhttps://www.peruforless.com/blog/quipu?utm_source=perplexity",
