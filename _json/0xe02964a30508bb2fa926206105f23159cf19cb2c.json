  "text": "Lace Ciphers, 2022\n\nThe problem of long-repeat strings generating delicate encodings has been known to signal processing people for decades. USB use(d) NRZI/RLL-6 encoding which forces a change between knit and purl once per seven stitches. Most Ethernet today uses 'Manchester' coding, which encodes bits as *pairs* of signals, so for example 1 \\-> knit-purl, 0 \\-> purl-knit. If applied to knitting the structure from this encoding can get very wavy over short stretches.",
